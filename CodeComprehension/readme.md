# Welcome to Pancake!
Pancake's are a great way to take food products and make a portable, flat food item.

Similarly, the Pancake library is useful for taking Ruby/Mongo/Database objects and turning them into "flat" text files that can be sent to, and consumed by, our friends. We can also use the library to go in reverse--that is, to take a pancake ("flat" file) from our friends, and turn each line into a new Ruby/Mongo/Database object.

## How to play with it:

-- `> ruby test.rb`  
4\ Change the contents of `test.rb` and/or `test.txt` to add fields, change formatting, and see how things break if you change them.  
5\ Become famous and die happy!
